      "category": "Environment",
      "content": "When autumn comes, trees start preparing for winter. During this time, the green pigment in leaves, called chlorophyll, breaks down. This happens because the trees stop making food using sunlight. As the green fades away, we see the other colors like red, orange, and yellow that were hiding underneath all along. Isnâ€™t it cool how nature changes with the seasons?"

      "category": "Animals",
      "content": "Animals living in cold places like the Arctic have special features to survive. Polar bears have thick fur and a layer of fat to stay warm. Penguins huddle together to share body heat, and some animals like arctic foxes change their fur color to white in winter to hide in the snow. These adaptations help them live in freezing conditions."
